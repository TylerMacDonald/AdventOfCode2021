# AdventofCode2021

Just my lame attempts at Advent of Code. I have completed years 2018, 2020, and going to be trying 2021. This is the first time I have uploaded them anywhere and I did it mostly for my own conveince.

I am not a programmer by profession, but enjoy coding on my own time.

Scores 2021:

Had a late start on Day 1, 6, and 11
