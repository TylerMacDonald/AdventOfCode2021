# AdventofCode2021

Just my lame attempts at Advent of Code. I have completed years 2018, 2020, and going to be trying 2021. This is the first time I have uploaded them anywhere and I did it mostly for my own conveince.

I am not a programmer by profession, but enjoy coding on my own time.

Scores 2021:

Had a late start on Day 1, 6, and 11... Day 18-20 kicked my ass... 
Day 22, At my families for holiday, gave up on part 2 about an hour into start, came back to it the next day.
